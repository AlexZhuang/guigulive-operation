The used gas for running calculateRunway() after adding each new employee are the following,
1694 gas
2475 gas
3256 gas
4037 gas
4818 gas
5599 gas
6380 gas
7161 gas
7942 gas
8723 gas

Gas is increasing, the reason is that calculateRunway() sum over all salary from an array. Increasing length of array
caused increasing gas.

To solve the issue, I create a global variable 'current_totalSalary', when we run addEmployee(), we just add the new
employee's salary to current_totalSalary; when we run removeEmployee, we just subtract the removed employee's salary
from current_totalSalary; when we run updateEmployee(), we just update current_totalSalary by adding the difference between
new salary and old salary.

After making the change, the gas used for running calculateRunway() after adding new employee become 852, which is a
constant amount.
